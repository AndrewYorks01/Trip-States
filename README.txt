This program uses Python and Pandas to show the states I visited on various vacations
I recorded in "trip journals," dating back to 2007.

The program has two modes. The program can either show which vacations I visited a 
particular state, or can show all the states I visited on a particular vacation.

The vacations are as follows:
First big trip (2007) - The primary areas visited in this vacation are Yellowstone,
Yosemite, Sequoia, and Grand Canyon.

Great Lakes trip (2009) - The primary areas visited in this location are the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan and Voyageurs.
